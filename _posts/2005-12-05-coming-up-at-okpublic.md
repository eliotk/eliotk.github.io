Here is a snapshot of a redesign for okPublic that I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;m going for a softer and more &#8216;humane&#8217; look. I know that this is what I would like in my hosting company and I think that going down this path with distinguish us from the rest.

I know the picture is fuzzy, but do drop a comment if you have any thoughts on the direction.

Also, Nils &#8211; a member of okPublic and web craftsman &#8211; is helping out with the development. Check his stuff out at [The Swede][2]. I&#8217;m loving his layout for the [BU Video Game Society][3].
