Wuhf! Been awhile. I got trapped in a time warp of sorts.

I think these motivational messages that were on the wall at the Bickford&#8217;s that C and I visited Friday night pulled me out of it.

One went something like this:

> You are born with nothing. Everything that you gain after that is profit.

The other one went something like this:

> To err is human. To admit to your mistakes is superhuman.
