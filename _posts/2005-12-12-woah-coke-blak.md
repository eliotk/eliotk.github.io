Apparently Coke is releasing a new beverage that combines regular Coke with *coffee*!

[Here us the official Coke press release about it.][1]

> Coca-Cola Bl?k is an invigorating and stimulating blend that has a perfect balance of the effervescent taste sensation of Coca-Cola and natural flavors, with real coffee. The lightly carbonated, mid-calorie beverage, which is designed to appeal to adult consumers, is yet another example how The Coca-Cola Company reaches out to new audiences and addresses new beverage occasions.
