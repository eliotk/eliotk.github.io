So quoth* the [venerable Arthur Mullen][1]:

> Remarkable coincidence to the black box inside my brainbox that in the human ocean two beings can find themselves riding the same rails twice. But then my brain is a recrafted graft made of cartiledge from my butt.

*Amen.*

* An excellent Scrabble word, one of the very few that contains a disclaimer about it&#8217;s stag lifestyle in the online version of the [Official Hasbro Scrabble Dictionary][2]:

> QUOTH is the only accepted form of this verb; it cannot be conjugated
