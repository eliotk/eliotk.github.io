Oooieee. I&#8217;m psyched to wrap *something* up, and something that I&#8217;ve been excited to work on (with the typical downtime in this particularly dark era of the year).

Loving the progress and completion that&#8217;s been happening recently &#8211; C gave 120% so kindly and generously to the seasonal cause of good will toward all. And got a 5 spot in return. But that&#8217;s what makes her so awesome.

Ars so generously cured me of my automotive woes for the time being, donating her downtime to my uptime.

Art and I laid down a girthy amount of audio as well as a sound way to go head-to-head with time.

Mas sent up a shipment of warm and soft goods. I can&#8217;t thank her enough for everything.

Off to Market Basket for Talapia and such.
