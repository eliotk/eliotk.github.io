I was rummaging through a massive stack of unlabeled CD&#8217;s a couple nights ago and came across an audio track of a song that my friend Chris Wetzel and I had wrote and recorded circa 1999.

Chris did the music and I was mixmaster, which involved an analog casette 4-track. We both helped with the lyrics (funny and sweet in retrospect).
