Seems as though Skype&#8217;s network is down and [they say][1] it&#8217;s a P2P software issue.

I first tried calling my ISP, Cox, to see if they had recently blocked ports required by Skype. Funny thing was, when I finally got to a human and explained the problem, the guy hung up on me! Coincidence? Not sure&#8230;

I checked [Google News][2] and the hits there showed the issue was on Skype&#8217;s end.

My Skype line isn&#8217;t crucial for my work, although I&#8217;m feeling some anxiety not being *connected*. I sure do feel sorry for companies that use Skype and are more phone-phocused.

Skype&#8217;s blog post says 12-24 hours &#8230; we&#8217;ll see.
