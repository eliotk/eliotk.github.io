*   Last Sunday Mom put together a most delicious cheese fondue dinner complete with kielbasa, french bread, veggies and baby gherkins. The 30 year old fondue pot produced a ghostly high-pitched squeal as it kept the cheese nice and melty but all in all it held up very well.  Ars, Mom, Dad, and I ate it in front of the fire. Warm food, warm house, warm people.
*   On Tuesday I was crowned mayor of [Christina&#8217;s Ice Cream on Foursquare][1]. I picked up a pint of pistachio and a pint of coffee toffee frozen yogurt. It feels good to be the king.
*   Christina made such deliciously memorable meals this week including pasta with homemade sauce and baked ginger veggies and garlic bread. She also made chicken parmesan with pastina. She definitely knows the path to my heart. <3
*   Liz and Julio put on this great installation show at [meme gallery][2] in Cambridge called [encontracosas][3] or &#8216;found things&#8217; that I went to on Friday Night. It was awesome. You&#8217;re encouraged to actually touch and play with all of the found things, move them around, stack them, spin them, mash them. All sorts of things. VHS cassettes, toys, furniture, photos, hair bands. All things lost or discarded at one point (or perhaps multiple points) and then found. It was cool to be part of the art like that. From the website: *In MEME, encontracosas: real time weavings uses installation and improvisation to form paths, webs, ensembles and gathering points made from found materials and sounds, creating new axes of ‘meeting/finding’ each other and things in space. **<span style="font-style: normal;">The axes of &#8216;meeting/finding&#8217; each other was the coolest part. There were always little things around to play with while I met people, which seemed to aid in lubricating those exchanges in a neat way. That and the people I met were so friendly like those who run the gallery &#8211; Vella, Derrick, Phil, and Sandreen.</span>** *Oh, and I got to spend some time with [the wolf moon][4] walking to and from meme. It was a beaut.
*   *<span style="font-style: normal;">Yesterday C and I went to <a href="http://1369coffeehouse.com/">1369</a> while we waited for a table at the <a href="http://eastcoastgrill.net/">ECG</a> for brunch. There was this neighborhood guy there that channeled some Daniel Johnston and he danced to the jangly music while he waited for his drink. He talked to C and I about how you used to be able to buy the male chicks that are now &#8216;discarded&#8217; at egg houses for 5 cents around Easter. He was great.</span>*
*   *<span style="font-style: normal;">Then onto an excellent brunch at the ECG served by the always gracious and wonderful <a href="http://3rdarm.biz">brunch captain</a>. Art steers that ship and he steers it well. Incidentally, Drew Houston, the founder and ceo of <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> came into the ECG when C and I were waiting to be seated but didn&#8217;t stay after he found out about the wait. When I mentioned it to Art, he offered that the Grill could have shared a brunch platter to his Dropbox <img src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> He and his team have created an awesome product for wicked easy sharing of files between computers and/or people and is worth checking out if you haven&#8217;t yet. <a href="http://startup.berkeley.edu/2010/02/01/drew-houston-of-dropbox/">Here&#8217;s a video of him</a> giving a talk at Berkeley recently.</span>*
*   *<span style="font-style: normal;">Then tonight Matt and I met up, got jazzed up about work talk over a burrito, then went to a Haiti Relief Concert that my friend Adam helped organize. It was a good time and this one band called Zili Misik really rocked it. Here is a video (although it doesn&#8217;t really do their live music and energy justice): </span>**

See you in a week, week in review.
