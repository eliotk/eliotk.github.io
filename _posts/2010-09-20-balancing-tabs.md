Tabs in web browsers are awesome. Want to view a new page but save the context of the current page? No problem. I shudder to think about going back to a tabless world.

But tabs can also be dangerous. I&#8217;ll be working on a website or just hyper-linking around and all of the sudden: *where the heck am I? How did I get here? Where am I going?*

And I&#8217;ll check out my tabs and they&#8217;ll be mad tabs open that don&#8217;t help to answer those questions. And usually, I&#8217;ll say, oh okay, I should be working on *this* now. Or I was looking into *that. *Then I&#8217;ll Proceed to open more tabs after choosing something.

Sometimes this is great. Like during very loose hyper-learning which is awesome for producing creative scattered brain showers (my Dad&#8217;s term :-).

But it&#8217;s bad for focus.

I guess it&#8217;s about achieving balance. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about delineating specific time slots for each because sometimes I just can&#8217;t focus on one particular thing and my time during those periods is better suited to ingesting data and connecting what might not be unconnected dots. Of course I think it&#8217;s important to recognize those times when the mind is an arrow capable of hitting focused targets and consciously work to keep the arrow pointed at the bullseye because of course cruising the web can be awesome for creativity and just thinking but it&#8217;s also [a cheap drug][1].
