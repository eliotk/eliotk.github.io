Spending upwards of eight hours a day sitting at a desk working on the computer takes a toll on your body. So over the last few years I&#8217;ve been thinking about ways to work my legs to keep my blood moving and muscles active while sitting at my desk.

My first thought was to try a typical hand/ped ergometer like this one:  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-149" title="ergometer" src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ergometer-shot.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />  
][1]I found though that because of the cycling motion, my knees would rise too high and hit the bottom of my desk and even if I could avoid that, the gross movement of the legs would work my hip joints causing me to rock in my chair. Not very conducive to focusing,

So Â rethinking it I decided that a more isolated pedal-based movement would be the way to go; no more knee hits and chair rocking.

I looked around to see what might be commercially available for this kind of thing but I didn&#8217;t find anything very appealing. Here are a couple of examples of related products that are marketed for what I was looking for:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-151" title="foot-rocker" src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/foot-rocker.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />][2]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153" title="foot-pedals-plastic" src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/foot-pedals-plastic1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />

My concern with these was that there was no real resistance to the pedal action and in turn would make the movements rather jerky which I&#8217;m pretty sure would turn most people off to these products after a bit of use.

I kept digging and I happened on the double bass drum pedal setup:

My friend Matt says that they&#8217;re popular among metalheads <img src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

But I thought it was perfect because it had a pedal for each foot, had resistance from the springs shown in the picture and was constructed of sturdy hardware.

I bought one from Amazon.

Right around this time I began thinking that if I&#8217;m going to be expending energy while I&#8217;m working at my desk, why not convert that energy to electricity? And that would add an additional motivation for using the pedals. I juice up my computer and monitors while I was at it. Hey, *why not*?
