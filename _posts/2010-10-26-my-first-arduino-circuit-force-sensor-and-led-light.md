I received my Arduino board in the mail yesterday and setup my first circuit with an FSR sensor and an LED using [this great tutorial][1].

The LED lights up when force is applied to the sensor and its brightness is determined by how much force is applied. Here it is in action:



I&#8217;m looking forward to getting busy with some more complex projects using the FSR!
