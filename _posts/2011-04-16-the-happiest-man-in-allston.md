There is a man that stands on the sidewalk of the Mass Pike overpass on Cambridge Street looking out over the train yard and downtown Boston. He turns to me as I ride by, beckoning me with his hand pointing and his eyes glowing to look at the scene with him. His smile is coast to coast. &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right on,&#8221; I say with my eyes and my hands. &#8220;That&#8217;s a beautiful site. Thank you for sharing your joy with me. &#8220;
