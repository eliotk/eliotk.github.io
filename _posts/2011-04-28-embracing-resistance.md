The wind pummels into me as I bike down Western Ave trying to get to work in the morning. Good. It works my legs more to help build my muscles up.

The water cooler bottle is empty. Nice. A chance to get my blood going changing it after too much time sitting at the computer.

A couple close friends are encountering another kind of resistance. And it&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s supposed to be. But I am happy for them because of what they will gain from it.

It&#8217;s all in the framing.
