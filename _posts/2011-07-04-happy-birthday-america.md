Happy Birthday to you America!

In honor of your birthday, I&#8217;ve created this alternative flag:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-221" style="border: 4px solid #EEE;" title="new-flag" src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/new-flag.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="221" />][1]

The stripes are zebra stripes to represent your animalistic nature and to remind us that we are all sharing a greater global animal kingdom.

The stars are displayed as a node map of the Internet. There are millions of nodes just as there are millions of people living in your boundaries. It&#8217;s to celebrate that, as individual states of being, each one of us is connected to the next in multiple ways.

The black star in the corner is to represent those in our society that our stateless. Those that have been disconnected from the network through discrimination, injustice, ignorance and intolerance. The lone stars of our country. But there&#8217;s hope. The nodes are slowly becoming more connected and less isolated.

You&#8217;ve always offered hope, America. Cheers to that.
