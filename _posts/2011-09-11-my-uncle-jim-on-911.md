> Jim Kristan is part of the minority. The Army veteran, who served 20 years in the service, has dedicated his life to honoring the 9/11 victims, particularly those of United Airlines Flight 93. Passengers tried to overtake terrorists on the plane, which eventually crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pa., where Kristan will attend a ceremony on the 10th anniversary.
> 
> The Kentwood man is president of the West Michigan 9/11/01 Memorial that was founded, Kristan said, to carry on the memory of that day. He drives a pickup emblazoned with more than $10,000 in airbrushed artwork commemorating the date. Included are elaborate images of the two World Trade Center towers exploding and firefighters running into the buildings. There are depictions of the Pentagon and the Statue of Liberty crying with an American flag in the background.
> 
> He said people appreciate his efforts, even if they don’t share his enthusiasm.
> 
> “This is my entire life,” Kristan said. “It’s totally engulfed me, and I’m up 18 hours a day thinking about it. It’s my mission in life to make sure people remember and make each other’s lives better.
> 
> “I’m one of the 1 or 2 percent. The other 98 percent have gone on to what they do. That’s all right. That’s life.”
