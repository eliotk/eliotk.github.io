I&#8217;m really excited by [skills.to][1], a new web app created by [Tasty Labs][2].

**What does it do?**

It&#8217;s super simple actually. You input skills that you have, say programming or auto repair. You can then ask your friends to endorse you for a particular skill via Twitter.

In addition, and what I think is extra special about the app,  you can add skills and endorse skills of other users.

The site uses Twitter for authentication and handle creation. When you authenticate with Twitter, your Twitter graph is imported and you&#8217;re shown a list of the people you follow, each with an input box that allows you to quickly add skills to any one of them. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:

<div id="attachment_336" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

    Portion of initial screen that let's you add skills to each Twitter user you're following

Oh and you can also search for people and skills.

**Why is it cool?**

***It&#8217;s an app that puts the notion that we are each other&#8217;s agent (or keeper) front and center.***

I was talking with my friend Nagle the other night about how to do a better job thinking of myself as an agent to my friends and loved ones. I feel it&#8217;s both an important and rewarding responsibility that we all have.

Many times though I get caught up in my own world and, even though it&#8217;d be easy to do the task it takes to be an agent  (e.g. connect people that might be a good fit for whatever reason), it gets put in the queue and more often than not expires there.

That conversation with Nagle led to wondering if there could be a more structured way that promotes and maybe even facilitates this concept of being each other&#8217;s agent. Like something that could be programmed or a tool that could help with this responsibility.

Of course, it&#8217;s inherent to the concept of responsibility that there will always be work and commitment involved, which can&#8217;t be automated away. But maybe some of that work could be sublimated by processes that positively remind us of our responsibilities as well as the resulting rewarding feelings upon fulfillment of those responsibilities.

So I think in it&#8217;s own small way, skills.to does just that. It provides a frictionless way to immediately become an agent for the people in our lives by endorsing them through highlighting the skills that they embody.

Another neat side of the app it that is has the potential to offer a prismatic view of someone&#8217;s identity as it relates to his or her skillset. I recently watched [this talk][3] by Chris Poole, the founder of 4chan, and he talks about how identity is prizmatic; each of us wears many different hats in our lives and are viewed differently by different people. Since identity at skills.to is shaped by input from each person&#8217;s network, the resulting skillset could be a much more prizmatic view of who someone is.

For instance, I added the following skills for my friend [Matt][4]:

*   frontend programming
*   ui design
*   bass guitar

I&#8217;ve worked with Matt so I can attest to his skills as they relate to his professional work and I also have heard him play a bunch with his band [Spirit Kid][5] so I know he&#8217;s a great bass player. I know Matt also plays hockey but I don&#8217;t know much at all about hockey and I haven&#8217;t seen him play. But maybe a fellow hockey player of his will add that to his skillset. This format of having people in one&#8217;s network contribute creates a richer understanding of someone.

&#8211;

It&#8217;s exciting to think of ways that Tasty Labs could develop skills.to using it&#8217;s current basic functionality. For instance, as the data set grows, additional context could be added like location. Then searching for individuals could become a more powerful experience. For instance, I could search for people with the skill of &#8220;tennis&#8221; in and around Cambridge to find new tennis partners. Of course it&#8217;d be very useful in this way for seeking new professional relationships but I think it&#8217;s much more dynamic than something like LinkedIn because it isn&#8217;t restricted to that single dimension of what you do for money.
