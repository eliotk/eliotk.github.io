[InnoCentive][1], the organization that facilitated the [Street Bump competition][2] that my friends and I participated in and won this past summer released a video montage about our team. They used video and photos that were taken during our process. They even include the video in which Nagle and I get approached by the police for walking into the street to size up potholes! <img src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
