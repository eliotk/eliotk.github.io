There&#8217;s a fast-paced yoga routine that I like to do at home called [Yoga and Pilates &#8211; Hips, Buns and Thighs Yoga Season: 1][2]. My friend Josh showed it me. It&#8217;s lead by a guy named Tom Morley. Just when things get tough during the routine and I feel like I&#8217;m doing an advanced twister move, Tom Morley reminds me to &#8220;keep a poker face&#8221;. When he says it, I immediately notice that my face is squished and tense. I relax my facial muscles. All of the sudden I feel much better and I start breathing again. It&#8217;s like a weight gets lifted.

C and I have been in process of moving to our new place in Somerville. Needless to say things have been tense with shuffling gazillions of atoms across town and saying goodbye to our sweet home only seconds to Inman.

When I remember Tom Morley&#8217;s simple yet wise direction, I relax my facial muscles and things seems just a little bit brighter.

It&#8217;d be interesting to try and setup some sort of monitoring approach that would know when your face is tense and tell you automatically to keep a poker face. MaybeÂ [OpenCV][3] could be trained to do this. Future project perhaps? <img src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
