Here&#8217;s a thought: Audio QR codes. Short snippets of audio that when &#8220;scanned&#8221; (recorded and processed) by a device like a smartphone would translate into data like a website URL. They could be used to transmit additional data related to any sort of audio output including radio, television or even music.

I caught the tail end of an NPR program the other day that sounded really interesting. I didn&#8217;t have too much to go by to look it up later on the web. Also, later might never happen. So it&#8217;d be sweet if there was an audio QR code that I could record on my phone and provide me with the proper links and related information.

The actual code being transmitted could be encoded in a form not unlike early telephone-based modems although ideally with more pleasant tones <img src="http://www.eliotk.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> I think it would be really interesting to play with this idea in music as the code could both be musical but also a way of transmitting information reminiscent of the the African talking drums. Perhaps too when musicians play live music, if there was a simple enough language, data could even be created and relayed on the fly. I&#8217;ve heard that Phish has a language of notes and chords that the band members use it to &#8220;talk&#8221; to each other while they&#8217;re jamming. Maybe though trying to incorporate an additional layer of information would be distracting to the base language of music.
