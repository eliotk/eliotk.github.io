Want.

But why do I want it? And why is a tiny house attractive to a lot of [other][2] [people][3] too?

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about the hardware, actually owning the house. It&#8217;s about the constraint the hardware puts on the software. What can go in the house and what the house can handle. The simpler (and better) living that might develop when we are weighed down less by the stuff we have. Burdened less mentally by the overhead of being responsible for and to a great deal of atoms in physical space.

I think that&#8217;s why a tiny house is cool.

But is it really such a simple relationship that the more stuff you have = more psychological complexity? And in turn, stress?

Maybe there are other ways of simplifying our relationship to physical things for the better without having to move into a tiny house. Things aren&#8217;t inherently bad of course. We can do amazing things with things. Our things can act as signals to other people to help facilitate connections. We can use things to help us dream and build.

These are some of the ideas and questions I&#8217;ve been thinking about in building [hasthat.com][4], a web-based storage unit for the things we own.  The idea really struck me when I was anguishing over all of the things that surfaced when we had to move apartments recently. It was tough to process. All of those things were only loosely organized in my head. By offloading them to hasthat.com, maybe I&#8217;ll be able to harness more of a tiny house mentality.
