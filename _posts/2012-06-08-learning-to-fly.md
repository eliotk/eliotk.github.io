Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve had the good fortune of tossing a frisbee with my friend [Raph][1].

He&#8217;s a frisbee master. It&#8217;s estimated that he has reached the Malcolm Gladwell denoted 10,000-hour-expert-level of playing frisbee.

He&#8217;s also a masterful teacher.

When we first went out I had never thrown a forehand pass. I mean I may have a few times. But I had only ever really used my backhand. I always marveled at good frisbee throwers and their forehand throws.  So elegant and effortless!

Our first time out, Raph showed me the finger position for the forehand. Middle finger on the inside rim of the disc and the forefinger extended further inside on the flat of the disc for leveling.

&#8220;Use just your wrist to start. Get that motion down first.&#8221;

So at short distances I flicked my wrist, letting the frisbee roll off my middle finger to get it to spin.

Wobble, wobble, wobble. Back and forth, back and forth.

&#8220;Use just your wrist,&#8221; he reminded me when I would put my arm into it.

Back and forth, back and forth.

Soon I was getting the disc leveled out and enough spin on it to get it to him fairly consistently.

We started to move further away from each other.

I would watch him and his throws. So effortless. The action all in his wrist and arm. The rest of his body still and sure.

&#8220;It should feel like air hockey.&#8221; The disc just floating on air. That&#8217;s what makes it work. Not injecting strength into the propulsion of the disc like a backhand but finding the right action and finesse to harness the disc&#8217;s natural capacity to float on air.

Back and forth, back and forth.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t step into it.&#8221;

&#8220;Keep your body facing me.&#8221;

I watched his body and listened to his sage advice. And I slowly adjusted my actions to match his. Learning frisbee like this is exciting in that I have this mirror-like ideal every-time Raph would throw to me.

*He&#8217;s letting his arm drop out of the way, that&#8217;s right, I think I&#8217;ve been forgetting about that.*

Back and forth, back and forth.

*Make sure the disc is leveled out by your forefinger before releasing to avoid that angle.*

Back and forth, back and forth.

We&#8217;ve started to move further away and my throws are getting more accurate, more controlled.

And the other day, it happened. Back and forth, back and forth. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about specific mechanics and something magical emerged. I wasn&#8217;t working the disc. I only encouraged the disc to work the air. It sailed. It felt so good. It was air hockey.
