It&#8217;s tough picking back up projects after being away for some time.

When a project is new, it&#8217;s exciting. The mind easily focuses in on it. Getting lost in the mechanics, the how to and the end vision. And the body follows suit, making working on it easy andÂ rhythmic. Flow-like.

Jaimie Mantzell just started back in on his giant robot project. He&#8217;s a cool guy. You should [follow him on Youtube][1].

Here&#8217;s a video where he&#8217;s getting back to work on the giant robot project:



&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of weird coming back into a project after not working on it for a while. It&#8217;s like coming into someone else&#8217;s project, &#8216;I have a no idea what&#8217;s going on here!&#8217;&#8221;

It&#8217;s tough.

Recently I&#8217;ve done my own refocusing on the [exo][2] project as well as the trike project. I&#8217;d really like to wrap those up or at least get them to a much more finished state. Just have to put one foot in front of the other.

With the exo project, I&#8217;m making the leap to using window lift motors that I&#8217;ll convert into big servos that I can use for the joint actuation in place of the wiper motor servos.These will be lighter and stronger and also, because they have worm gears, they&#8217;ll be able to maintain a fixed position without the need for battery-draining powered locking. I&#8217;m psyched to get started integrating these into the design and I just ordered a seemingly hackable one from AME Equipment.

With the trike project, I got some metal work and welding done on the head rest. And I also have new foam cut out for the seat cushioning and seat cover material on the way to wrap them up.

Powering up!

It&#8217;s kind of daunting getting back into projects after a hiatus but once you&#8217;re stepping through the motions again the mind starts wrapping around the mechanics and the flow can flow.
