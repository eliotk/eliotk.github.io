I&#8217;ve started building a device that can be added to a mobility scooter (used by people with disabilities) to bring the user to a standing position.

Here&#8217;s a video I shot of my latest progress:



In the video is the add-on frame made with 80/20 aluminum extrusion and a linear actuator that sits on top of the original seat base of a mobility scooter. In this case it is an Amiga seat base.

The electric linear actuator lifts the top rails to a 90 degree angle at which point the person sitting on it would be in a standing position.

The original seat from the scooter would be bolted on to the top rails and then I&#8217;m going to work out how the back rest will be positioned to the top rails along with a linkage that would keep it at the correct angle while the position changes from seated to standing.

I plan on using the scooter batteries for the power to the linear actuator and also incorporating a DPDT momentary rocker-style switch inline to allow the user to control the actuator.

Also, knee locks will be incorporated into the stander as well as perhaps a frame and tray for the user to access when she&#8217;s in the standing position.
