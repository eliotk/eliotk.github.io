The scooter standing frame project is coming along.

This week so far I&#8217;ve:

* tested the new seat mechanism on the scooter  
* repositioned the linear actuator so that when the stroke is fully extended while standing the angle of the seat base to the floor is more of a right angle  
* begun to shape the seat base out of plywood I harvested from a discarded massage table  
* begun to work out the angle of the linkage for the back rest so that it morphs from a 90 degree angle with the seat base when sitting to a 180 degree angle when it goes to standing  
* bought some female quarter inch wire connectors to hook up the dpdt switch to the battery and linear actuator
